# Location Tracker (.NET MAUI)

This project is a location tracking app built with **.NET MAUI** and **C#**.  
It tracks the user’s location in real time, saves the coordinates in an **SQLite** database, and displays them on a **Google Map** as a heat map showing the user’s movement path and density of visits.
